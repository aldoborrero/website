Hello there üëãüèª (as Obi-Wan Kenobi would say)!

I'm Aldo (as you may have guessed), a software engineer who has been writing code for over a decade.

I used to work for different companies (ranging from Banks to Startups), and at some point 7 years ago, I decided to switch to freelancing. More recently I set up [41North](https://41north.dev) with my partner [Brian](https://bmcgee.ie/).

In this space, you'll find different types of posts, but primarily those related to the things that I care about most these days (i.e., Ethereum, Nix, Open Source, etc.).

If you want to get in touch, you'll find my other channels at the bottom of the page.

See you in another post!
