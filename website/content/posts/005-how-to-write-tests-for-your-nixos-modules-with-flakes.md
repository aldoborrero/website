What if I tell you the following?

> Get ready to experience the power of NixOS configurations, made easy with Nix's innovative feature - Declarative NixOS configurations that can be managed with just a few lines of Python code and the trusted QEMU backend.
>
> Trust the NixOS tests to ensure that your NixOS system is performing optimally. These tests have been tried and tested by the Nix community, and you can run them on any Linux machine, with MacOS support coming soon.
>
> Eliminate the guesswork from your integration tests with Nix's reproducible design. This makes it the perfect addition to your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, giving you peace of mind that your tests are reliable every time.
